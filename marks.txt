[X] 05 2. There are consistent menus across all pages of the site.
[X] 05 3. The site has a reasonable appearance.
[X] 05 4. CSS has been used for the layout.
[X] 05 5. The HTML of the pages validates as HTML5.
[X] 05 6. The CSS of the pages validates.

Section 2: Structure and Merchandise

[X] 05 1. The site has a home page, a user login page, a manager login page and
          one page each for Books, Music, Games and DVDs.
[X] 05 2. There are at least two items for sale in each category, i.e. Books,
          Music, Games and DVDs, each with a price.
[X] 05 3. Each item for sale has a picture (we are not too strict about the
          picture).
[ ] 05 4. The user can restrict the number of items for sale which are
          displayed on a page to a specified number (done with Javascript).

Section 3: Log on and Purchase

[X] 05 1. The user can log in to the site and log off again using their
          customer_number and passwd from the customer table in the database.
          Specifically, user 1001 can log in with password 'Alan' and this is
          checked by searching the database.
[X] 05 2. The user can 'purchase' an item which is for sale, but only when
          logged in. No 'shopping cart' needed, just click on a button next
          to the item and it is purchased immediately if the user is logged
          in. Otherwise, it can say 'not logged in' or similar.
[X] 05 3. There is Javascript validation of login information. It should check
          that username is a number and that the password submitted is not
          null.
[X] 05 4. The manager can log on to the site. Specifically, manager_number 100
          can log in with passwd 'Adam', and this is checked in the database.
[X] 05 5. The manager can view the contents of all the database tables but only
          when logged in.LOOK AT
[ ] 05 6. The manager can restrict information in the customer_order table on
          the manager page to a range of dates (done with Javascript). The
          range can be applied either to the order_date or to the
          shipping_date.
[X] 05 7. Stock goes down when an item is purchased. This will be verified by a
          user making a purchase, followed by looking at the item__stock_count
          column in the inventory table when logged on as manager.
[X] 05 8. An item which is out of stock may not be purchased. For example,
          Item "AA01-006", i.e. "Times Good University Guide 2014" is out of
          stock.
[X] 05 9. The database includes the filename for an item's image,
          i.e. column item_image_loc in the inventory table includes a
          filename. This will be checked from the manager page. Moreover, this
          filename is extracted from the database dynamically along with the
          other information about a product and used to create a display of
          products for sale which matches the products listed in the database
          at that time.
[X] 05 10.For a new order, a delivery date two days in the future is recorded
          in the database. This will be checked by ordering an item and then
          from the manager page looking for one new entry in the customer_order
          table and one new entry in the order_item table. (We assume a
          customer orders one item only and there is one customer_order and one
          order_item for that item.)

Explanation of the marking scheme
---------------------------------

Consider the line:

[X] 05 4. The manager can log on to the site.

It means that if your website has the facility for a manager to log on and this
works, it counts for 5% of the assignment mark.

If you think that your website has this facility, you should add a Y like this:

[X] 05 4. The manager can log on to the site.

If you do not think it has this facility, leave the line as it is.

We will check your website on the server to see if it includes this
facility. If we cannot verify that it has, then you will not get the marks. If
your judgements are radically different from ours, we will question you. So
please fill in the marks as accurately as possible.

Other important points
----------------------

NB: Your website *must* include a button on the homepage marked 'Reset DBase'
which when pressed calls reset.jsp which re-sets the database on the server to
a form which will work properly with your website. We will run this before we
begin assessing your site. Remember, we have supplied such a script but you
need to add to this any other data (e.g. product image filenames) or table rows
which are necessary, and make sure the script can be run from your site when
it is on the server.

Your website *must* also have another button on the homepage marked 'Marks'
which points to a file called marks.txt (this file you are reading) where you
have placed an X on each line where you think your website has the feature
requested. Note that if the assignment markers are unable to verify a point or
they do not agree that you have satisfied the point, then they will not award
you the marks for that point.

After re-setting the database, all the original tables must be present and each
table must include exactly the original rows of data. Note however that the
column item_image_loc in existing rows of the inventory table may be changed to
the appropriate filename of the image depicting the product. Note also that
there may be some additional rows of data composed by you in each table at your
discretion (e.g. to fill out the product pages a little and to show certain
features).

You *must* use JSP/JSTL for your website. You may not use PHP, ASP etc. You may
not use jQuery or any other third party libraries except those explicitly
provided in the labs and taught in the lectures. All code must be your own
work, but you may use code from the examples given in the lectures and
labs. You may not use Dreamweaver or any similar software for any part of the
assignment.

We may call you for interview before the end of term to answer detailed
questions about your assignment. We will contact you if this is necessary.

You must upload the .war of your assignment to the Faser system by the
deadline.
